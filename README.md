- Why beta (all features are not complete yet, its on testing)

1.5.1 : 
- Fully fixed destroy and the queue handling for delete, also now it deletes from lavalink...

- Updated `AQUA` with additional cleanup options, faster response arrays, Remade `ConstructResponse` and `resolve`, and improved the `UpdateVoice` handler.
- Updated `CONNECTION` to fix bugs, improve the cleanup system, and Improve speed.
- Improved cleanup in the `NODE` manager and fixed issues for VPS.
- Rewrited the `TRACK` handler for better speed by removing redundant checks and code.

# Basic usage

```javascript
// If you're using Module, use this:
// import { createRequire } from 'module';
// const require = createRequire(import.meta.url);

//const { Aqua } = require('aqualink');

        port: 233,
        secure: false,
        name: "localhost"
    }
];

const aqua = new Aqua(client, nodes, {

        voiceChannel: message.member.voice.channel.id,
        textChannel: message.channel.id,
        deaf: true,
    });

    const resolve = await client.aqua.resolve({ query, requester: message.member });

    if (resolve.loadType === 'playlist') {
        await message.channel.send(`Added ${resolve.tracks.length} songs from ${resolve.playlistInfo.name} playlist.`);

        player.queue.add(track);

        await message.channel.send(`Added **${track.info.title}** to the queue.`);

        if (!player.playing && !player.paused) return player.play();

    } else {
        return message.channel.send(`There were no results found for your query.`);
    }
});

client.aqua.on("nodeConnect", (node) => {

});
